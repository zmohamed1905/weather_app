Get API Key:

As we used third party Weather API to get weather details, you need to visit OpenWeatherMap to get API key to use in this application.

Steps to generate an API key:

- Login to Open Weather Map.
- Then go to the My API Keys section. Then click API Keys section and there you will get default API key. You can also create new API keys.
- Then go to API section and get the API link to use in your script api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
